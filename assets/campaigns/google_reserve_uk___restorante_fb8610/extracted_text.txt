MICROBUSINESSES IN

THE UK:

RESTAURANTS BARS & CAFÉS

1. IMPORTANCE OF RESTAURANTS, BARS & CAFÉS

In the UK, small food & beverage outlets restaurants, pubs, cafés, and takeaway shops are predominantly microbusinesses with fewer than 10 employees. They represent a significant portion of the hospitality sector and are crucial to local economies.

•Depend heavily on local visibility and immediate customer bookings.

•Google is often the first stop for UK consumers searching for lunch spots, dinner reservations, or coffee shops nearby.

•Movylo Reserve with Google allows these businesses to connect instantly with diners at the exact moment they are looking to book or visit.

•Supplies: Food and beverage costs fluctuate due to supply chain issues post-Brexit.

•Marketing & customer acquisition: Budgets are limited, typically 2–6% of annual turnover (£5,000–30,000 for many small restaurants).

Implication: Investing in standalone booking systems or marketing campaigns is often prohibitive. A free tool like Movylo Reserve with Google removes this financial barrier while driving reservations directly.

UK	MARKETING	TRENDS

•Be visible online when diners search for nearby eateries.

•Offer frictionless booking directly on Google without additional apps.

•Track real, measurable results reservations and orders without complex systems.

Why Google matters: The majority of UK consumers start restaurant searches on Google, making integrated bookings essential.

COMMON PROBLEMS FOR

UK	RESTAURANTS

Lack of time to manage marketing campaigns.

Fragmented platforms: booking software, POS, websites, social media.

Difficulty tracking return on marketing investment.
